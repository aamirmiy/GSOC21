Dimensionality Reduction for Studying Diffuse Circumgalactic Medium Evaluation Test

The repository contains Notebooks pdfs and the models used for completing the evaluation tasks.<br><br>
In the Models folder inside the Autoencoder folder, the <b>mlp_encoder_model.sav</b> corresponds to the stacked encoder and the <b>mlp_autoencoder.sav</b> corresponds to the basic autoencoder.<br><br>
<b>The graphs are not visible for some reason in the task2 notebook hence please refer the task2 pdf<b>.<br><br>
Task3 contains the code for the dimensionality reduction along with results,conclusion and future work<br>
The link to the pdf of Task3 is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QwnzVJi4llrhq5Dx3Nxg9sF9adWnv29R/view?usp=sharing
